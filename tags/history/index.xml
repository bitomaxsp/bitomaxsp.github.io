      <description>Past I have a degree in design and production of radio electronic equipment. I also graduated from MSU as a professional photojournalist.
But i think it all began around &amp;lsquo;84 when could barely walk and found my father&amp;rsquo;s closet with tools and picked a screwdriver as my favorite tool. Also its my first uttered word at that time (of course it was in Russian). In case you are curious which screwdriver it was: it was slotted 0.6x3.5 mm. And since then I&amp;rsquo;d been disassembling all the things around me, most of the time without possibility to recover its original state. But things changed over time, I got some experience and started to assemble them back over time.</description>
